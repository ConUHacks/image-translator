# image-translator
App to translate objects found in images

This application takes a picture, assigns tags to it, and translates them. This allows the user to communicate with any person of foreign tongue via pictures. This application has potential to destroy the boundaries of language and eliminate the final frontier for mankind. Indeed, as of today all dreams of the first fire worshipers have been conquered: flight, glorious art, unimaginable wealth, endless food, and calmness in charades.
